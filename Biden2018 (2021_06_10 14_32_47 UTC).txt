Biden 2018
I told the team that asked me to join
00:08
them as vice president that I would not
00:12
affirmatively make the case but that if
00:17
I was asked I would not remain silent
00:19
and and I've told you this before this
00:27
was not difficult for me you know ever
00:30
since the last time I've spoken to you
00:32
from this stage has been pointed out
00:35
we've made we've made progress
00:36
notwithstanding the onslaught by this
00:39
administration and the regressive
00:41
elements of American society but it was
00:45
a time of tremendous progress of the
00:46
story changed that you helped guide us
00:49
through in our administration because of
00:52
you because of you particularly people
00:56
like Dennis and Judy Shepard I don't
00:58
know where you are folks but stand up
01:05
I know
01:14
killing I though it is like to lose a
01:18
child we understand the pain never goes
01:22
away and I admire and I mean this from
01:25
the bottom of my heart I admire your
01:28
courage in every single day taking on
01:32
the elements that caused your son's
01:35
death but it takes an enormous courage
01:37
because every time you do it takes you
01:41
back to the moment you got the news we
01:43
owe you and I hope hope you know how
01:51
grateful we are as a nation for all that
01:54
you have done these 20 years to speak
01:57
out and demand a better safer world for
01:59
our children and the truth is the speed
02:02
with which things have changed is no
02:04
thanks to any national figure it's
02:08
because of people like I just introduced
02:11
people who encouraged to come out and
02:14
speak that's why I'm so happy to be here
02:17
to say thank you thank you two
02:19
generations of brave advocates from
02:21
Stonewall to act up the PFLAG miles to
02:24
sturb later we've come this far
02:28
because you spoke up because you
02:30
demanded justice because you've read
02:33
nigh to long and you didn't despite the
02:36
voices of intolerance that tried to tear
02:39
you down and many of you especially
02:40
those new closer to my age paid an
02:43
enormous personal price a professional
02:46
price and literally put your lives in
02:49
jeopardy to speak out that's why we are
02:52
you missed your livelihood your very
02:56
personal well-being but your tenacity
02:59
your integrity literally fit the arc the
03:03
moral arc of this nation much more
03:06
toward justice and thanks to you our
03:08
children my grandchildren will grow up
03:10
in a world that's far more just open
03:14
mind and humane but our work is not yet
03:17
done by any stretch of the imagination
03:19
the stakes are much too high as you know
03:23
when I was vice president I spent a lot
03:24
of time traveling around the world and
03:26
I'd speak out about this issue in these
03:29
countries and I'd be told in some of the
03:31
countries as cultural well let me tell
03:34
you something
03:35
those who try to excuse this kind of
03:37
discrimination name of culture I say
03:40
prejudice is prejudice and humanity as
03:43
humanity it is a crime
03:48
and here's a religion or culture as a
03:53
license to discriminate demonizing the
03:56
community individuals to score political
03:58
points is no more justifiable around the
04:01
world than today's here at home and our
04:04
policy should reflect that despite all
04:06
the progress we've made there are still
04:09
so many young people America who feels
04:11
so abandoned so long so afraid they
04:18
struggle it's a picture of future in
04:20
which they're safe affirmed or loved
04:24
some of you don't have to imagine what
04:26
that's like
04:28
because you lived through it you
04:31
remember those sleepless nights lying in
04:34
bed as a kid staring at the ceiling
04:36
wondering if or when to come out what do
04:41
I say what are they gonna say to be what
04:45
will happen the terror the terror in
04:51
your heart when you first spoke your
04:53
truth
04:54
coach I'm gay mom I'm transgender not
05:03
knowing how your loved one might respond
05:07
looking down the street how many have
05:10
you done this looking down the street
05:11
looking behind you to see yous watching
05:14
before you hold your partner's hand
05:17
we're still a kiss literally looking
05:22
over your shoulder all the time
05:27
that you're here tonight speaks to your
05:30
strength and to your resilience but I
05:34
suspect many of you got some help along
05:36
the way the teacher may have looked out
05:41
for you in the classroom and even in the
05:43
hallways of your school the relative or
05:47
neighbor who stood up for you when
05:48
others wouldn't the faith needed
05:52
reminding you that we're all born
05:54
perfectly created in God's image
05:58
the friends who fill the void of your
06:02
biological family with their
06:05
unconditional love acceptance and
06:07
support when you did not get it at home
06:11
no court decision or law or policy or
06:15
poll can replace the impact of the loss
06:20
of unconditional love it's not how we're
06:24
made up it's not the measure of decency
06:30
Michele Michele is a mother of an
06:33
active-duty marine who came out to her
06:36
over Skype while like my son was
06:40
deployed for a year overseas as a marine
06:43
in Michele's words quote she could see
06:50
quote a huge weight lifted off of him
06:55
when he came out with her and when her
07:00
son said he was afraid quote you and Dad
07:04
wouldn't love me anymore can you imagine
07:09
her response was her response was
07:14
exactly what every parent's response
07:17
ought to be she said I love you even
07:21
more because every single time you meet
07:25
someone who has hate in them
07:28
I'm sending extra love your way to get
07:31
you through those tough times
07:34
that's what mothers should do imagine
07:38
how relieved that young memory must have
07:40
felt at that moment imagine the burden
07:42
lifted off of him and many of you know
07:46
it to feel that certainty of a parent's
07:50
love all deployed thousands of miles
07:54
away in a battle zone to know you're not
07:57
alone we can't rest to all of our young
08:02
people or affirmative accept to accept
08:04
accepted the same exact way that's why I
08:08
feel alive when we set up the Biden
08:09
foundation as she spoke about recently a
08:14
loss of initiative as you are
08:16
that's the name initiative as you are
08:19
it's the beginning of a massive public
08:22
education campaign to raise awareness of
08:25
the importance of family acceptance in
08:27
the lives of LGBTQ young people people
08:31
fear what and who they don't know and
08:35
what they don't understand that's why
08:39
these stories have such incredible power
08:41
to reveal our common struggles and
08:44
shared humanity together we have to work
08:47
together to change our culture our
08:49
little culture to ensure a bright future
08:53
for all of our young people reason I'm
08:55
optimistic I understand the history of
08:57
the journey of this country I know we
09:00
can do this but I realized people these
09:04
days and maybe many of you are
09:05
pessimistic because of the personal and
09:08
political onslaught against the
09:10
community from so many quarters but I am
09:14
optimistic believe in how much more you
09:17
can do
09:21
the reason my son felt so strongly about
09:24
this and Jill and I do he died of cancer
09:28
a terrible disease we have a foundation
09:30
to try to end cancer as we know it this
09:34
is a disease and a plate on America this
09:38
disease of homophobia that we can end it
09:42
then we can save my grandkids my great
09:46
grandkids and thousands and thousands of
09:48
Americans and the rest of the world will
09:51
repair to the American Standard God love
09:54
you and then God protect our troops
